# Technical Challenge Question 2



## Description

A script that checks the validity of the passwords based on certain criteria.

The first part is checking the validity based on the old policy. The numbers represent the minimun and the maximum times a letter should appear in the password. 

The second part is checking the validity based on the current policy.The numbers represent two positions.For the password to be valid the letter should appear inside the password in one of the two indicated positions.If it appears on both of them or in any other position the password won't be valid.

Based on this once the page is loaded you can see the valid passwords based on both policies. Once you click on the buttons "First policy passwords" or "Second policy passwords" the lists ar being hidden and you can see the total count of the valid passwords of both of them.
